### 3: Research String Methods

Using [this link](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp) please describe any 3 methods, what they are used for and how to use them.

#### Method 1

```
Name: Slice Method

Description: extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
This example slices out a portion of a string from position 7 to position 12 (13-1).

Example:
```
let str = "i, love, coding";
str.slice(3, 6)     // Returns love

#### Method 2

```
Name: substring() Method

Description: substring() is similar to slice().
The difference is that substring() cannot accept negative indexes

Example:
```
let str = "i, love, coding";
str.slice(3, 6)     // Returns love

#### Method 3

```
Name: The replace() method

Description: The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:

Example:
```
let text = "Please visit Apple!";
let newText = text.replace("Apple", "Banana");
